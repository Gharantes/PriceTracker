# PriceTracker

App will take a target price/discount as input + a game's steam ID, and will show 
said game in the "Deals" tab if its price goes below target price, or if its discount goes over target discount.

As of last commit, app is doing what it was initially meant to do. Roadmap is the following:

1. Just make app look better 
2. Try to make GOG API work
3. Build .exe or installer
4. Epic's API
5. Export and Import Database
